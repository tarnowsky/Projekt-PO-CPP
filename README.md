# "World Simulation" Project

## Description
The "World Simulation" project is a Object-Oriented, self-playing game.
The simulation showcases interactions between various objects representing animals in a virtual ecosystem.

## Project Goals
- Demonstrate object-oriented programming skills in C++
- Practical application of OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation
- Utilization of the C++ standard library

## Features
1. Automatic world simulation with various animal species
2. Interactions between animals, including hunting, reproduction, and migration
3. Cyclic updates of the world state
4. Visualization of the simulation in console or simple graphical interface

## Technologies
- Programming language: C++
- C++ Standard Library:
  - Containers (e.g., vector, map)
  - Algorithms
  - Input/output handling
- Object-Oriented Programming:
  - Classes and objects
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Encapsulation

## Project Structure
- Base class `Animal`
- Derived classes representing different animal species
- `World` class managing the simulation
- Helper classes for environment handling and interactions
